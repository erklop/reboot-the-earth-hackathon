## 🌰 Project Overview

**AgriShield.ai** is an AI-driven system designed to help almond farmers monitor smoke exposure, fire risk, and irrigation needs. The platform combines multiple APIs and datasets to provide actionable recommendations in real time.  
GOAL: IMPROVE an outdated water allocation system

Key features include:  
- Smoke Exposure Index calculation  
- Fire proximity monitoring using NASA FIRMS  
- Weather and evapotranspiration data integration  
- Real-time irrigation recommendations  
- Interactive map visualization of farm location and nearby fires
